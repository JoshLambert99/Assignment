# Assignment
First Processing assignment December 2017



## Requirements
This assignment required me to create a UI for a sci-fi movie device that I could base on any movie I like or I could come up with my own.  
It had to include alot of the things we learned on the course aswell as things we haven't learned which required some amount of research.
One of the requirements for the assignment was also to use git and include an embedded youtube video of my assignment in the ReadMe.md file.

## Overview
My assignment isas if you are looking out from a spaceship window, accompanied with a data analyzer, a radar, a rotating sphere and diagnostics (barchart with varying heights).
I also added stars around the spaceship to add to the space-like design.
I started my project by looking up different ideas for a sci-fi HUD and then I narrowed it down to things i could actually implement. 
I first coded the simpler things in the assignment like the barchart and the radar before I coded the rotating sphere. I was proud of the rotating sphere because 3D graphics and images in processing is relatively new to me but i used the processing.org
site to help me. 
The last things I did was the control box and the analyzer which randomly picked y-values to make it look like heartbeat monitor (just alot faster) or data analyzer.
I then added in the stars using an array and for loop to make it more visually appealing. 
*Overall I'm proud of the sphere and the data analyzer.*
